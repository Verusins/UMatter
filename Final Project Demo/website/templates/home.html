      <h3>In and Out</h3>
      <h1>Deep Breathing</h1>
      <h2>Calm the Mind, Calm the Soul</h2>
      <p>To better understand your respiratory system, first picture a tree.

        The trachea, or windpipe, is like the trunk of the tree. From there, the airways divide and divide, like branches of a tree. At the end of a tree’s branches are leaves; similarly, the ends of the bronchioles have alveoli also known as air sacs, where gas exchange takes place.
        In the air sacs, freshly inhaled oxygen is passed to the blood, which is then pumped through the body; the air sacs also absorb carbon dioxide, which is then removed from the body through exhalation.
        The diaphragm, a thin muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities, tightens and pulls down as you breathe in, opening the chest cavity and allowing the lungs to expand. To breathe out, your diaphragm relaxes and moves upward, pushing air out.
        
        
        Though it may feel unnatural to breathe deeply, the practice comes with various benefits. Deep breaths are more efficient: they allow your body to fully exchange incoming oxygen with outgoing carbon dioxide. They have also been shown to slow the heartbeat, lower or stabilize blood pressure and lower stress.
        To experience deep breathing, find a comfortable place to sit or lie down. Breathe slowly and deeply through your nose, causing your stomach to rise and expand. Exhale fully.
        “Breathing deep for a minute isn’t going to improve your lung capacity,” Hoyt said. “But deep breathing is a good way to reduce stress and relax.”

      <h1>About üMatter</h1>
      <h2>Developed by Tharuth Attanayake and Sigmund Wang</h2>
      <p>üMatter wants to help people like you find and get the help they need, alongside learning more about some common mental health disorders, and some ways to help put your minds at ease.
        Our mission is to help you find out about mental health disorders, and small ways to possibly calm your minds, through our deep breathing and yoga subpages!
        We also have a small test to help  decide whether additional help is recommended from professionals rather than just some random Computer Science students on the Internet, and pages to find what the help you deserve!
        Please, remember that we aren't professionals, and the test is more of an educated guess than anything else, rather than a diagonsis; we can and will be wrong, but just want to try and help.
        Always take care of yourself, you matter.
